# typewriter-python
Generating videos with typewriter effect using PIL and OpenCV

Heavily inspired by:
https://pjoshi15.com/create-typewriter-effect-animation-using-python/


How to run

First install the dependencies
```
pip install -U opencv-python
pip install pillow
```

Then

```
python typewriter_effect.py
```

You can change the `place='center'` value to make the text left or right aligned. The other settings are at the top of the script.
